Hello guys there are new events created by me.

== List of races ==
Granny Race: An event where cars from 300 PP or less are racing in the longest Nürburgring circuits with one lap added each.

Gran Turismo Memes 1: This event features the remakes of the Gran Turismo 2000 and the Historic Car Cup with the Ford GT40 from Gran Turismo 2 followed by a really crazy event where slower cars like the 2CV and Lunar Rover and faster cars like Red Bull X2014 and SRT Tomahawk GTS-R are joined in it.

Gran Turismo 2 Endurance Memes: This event features the replicas in the v1.0 version of the Trial Mountain 30 Lap Endurance with the BMW McLaren F1 GTR Race Car '97 being the alternate of the infamous Vector M12 LM Edition and the Special Stage Route 5 All Night with the Citroen Xantia (a city car) as a opponent

Heavy Duty Cup: This is a event only for cars that has 1650kg or more. This ranges from estates like Audi RS6 Avant, Volvo 240GLT to pickup trucks like the Silverado SST, Dodge RAM 1500 LARAMIE to heavyweight muscle cars like the Chevelle SS or the Superbird to even the large Jay Leno Tank Car.

Lamborghini Exclusive: As the name implies, this is a event directed to any road Lamborghini cars in italian circuits.

Myths and Lies: Based on the mexican youtuber XTalenT from the "Mitos y Mentiras" series of videos. This event makes a test about what happen if you restrict racing tires in dirt/snow tracks, dirt tires in snow tracks, snow tires in dirt tracks as well as dirt/snow tires in road tracks in terms of handling. Also we made tests about what would happen if you put the maximum 32-bit integer in Rewards list as well adding a event with Kart Space here meaning that you can race with any car instead of forcing you to use only karts as well as a event in where fuel drains a lot if you put 255 in the fuel multipler aside of editing the rivals to put upgrades of turbo in non turbo applicable cars as well as custom paint in non-paintable cars especially concept cars.  In fact this is a test in where both slower and faster cars with both normal fuel hybrid fuel and electric engine are racing in order who drains the fuel faster. In fact, the electric engines drains faster than regular engine fuels and slower hybrid fuels are durable so watch out if your opponent is a Honda CR-Z because he can complete the race without draining all of his fuel.
